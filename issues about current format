for each topic, there're:
(1) vertically, procceding of logic toward the final goal(=solve the question), represented by increased number(1.1,1.2,1.3...)
(2) horizontally, divergence of each goal, represented by sub points(1, 1.1, 1.1.1, 1.1.1.1)

when we talk abt "paradigm", both vertical & horizontal paradigms are included. Isn't it redundant?
