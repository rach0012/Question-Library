mechanism = using a well-established theoretical framework to explain a specific phenomenon
framework eg: excitation/inhibition neural network; Bayesian optimization model; etc.

Q1 What is the phenomenon to be explained?
Q1.1 definition?
Q1.1.1 paraconcept
Q1.1.2 subconcept
Q1.1.3 related factors
Q1.2 what has been explained, what has not?(sharper the test of model, the better)
Q1.2.1 What are other competing theories?

Q2 How to used xxx framework to explain the phenomenon?
Q2.1 what are basic model parameters/components? How to set that?
Q2.2 what are necessary properties of a good model?(sanity check) --see if it contradicts with other phenomenon
Q2.3 specific propertes of model that adapt to better explain the phenomenon? -- see if it can really explain the phenomenon of question
Q2.4 does the model generate new predictions that can be tested independently?
