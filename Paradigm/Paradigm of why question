1.Why?
1.1 What is the mechanism of xxx?
1.2 What is benefit for the agent?
1.2.1 What is criterions of benefit?
1.2.1.1 Agent?
1.2.1.2 Benefit criterion
1.2.2 What is the deficiency of this strategy in giving benefit?
1.2.3 Are there any other strategy that have more benefit to the agent ?
1.2.4 Does these other strategies better than this?
1.2.5 Why do not use other strategy? 

Examples:
1. Why do we get a fevor？
1.1 What is the mechanism of getting a fevor?

1. Why there exists cooperation in the group of this kind of microbe?
1.2 What is benefit for the agent?
1.2.1 Agent?: Individual/genes of microbe.
1.2.2 Criterion?: Evolutionary fitness.
1.2.2 What is the deficiency of this strategy in giving benefit?: It can be cheat by cheaters.
1.2.3 Are there any other strategy that have more benefit to the agent ?: Cheater strategy
1.2.4 Does these other strategies better than this?: Not always. By relative recogition…

Q:What is the relationship between 1.n and 1.m?
Eg 1.1 and 1.2 are parallel questions. Namely, not all of them need to be answered? (Like if, else..)
However, 1.2.4 and 1.2.5 have logic relationship, namely, "Yes" answer of 1.2.4 seems necessary for asking 1.2.5. Otherwise, 
there will be infinitely loop. 1.2.5 to 1 to 1.2.5 to 1 …  
Also, 1.2.1 must be answered at first.

Answer: parallel (if else), ordered(successively/successivly+if else) , not ordered.

Q: Specificity of question may influence its paradigm. Like when we ask in the microbe instead of this specific kind of microbe,
we should ask why cooperation do not occur in other microbes? So this paradigm is not sufficient.
