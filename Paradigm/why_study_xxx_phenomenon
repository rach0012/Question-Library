(it's not a why question though. More about "how important" -- subjective metrics)
shows up at the beginning of any question network for phenomenon-driven/data-driven study


1-What's the functional significance? (Is that an important function?)
(In neuroscience: does that indicate computational significance for this phenomenon?)
possible answers:
-may serve as implementation of universal computation: say, divisive normalization

2-How prevalent this phenomenon is? *generality-principle
(In neuroscience: different animals? different tasks? different modelities? different brain regions? different time scale?)

3-Does it contradict current knowledge? *contradiction-principle
possible answers:
-

4-How well it has been explained? What haven't been explained?
(On what levels can we explain it? How quantitative we can explain it?)
