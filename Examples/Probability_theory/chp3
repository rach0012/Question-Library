Q1 Probability distribution of "urn with no replacement"?
Q1.1 General expression of the prob distribution: h(r|N,M,n)
Q1.1.1 intuitive interpretation for this result?
to simplify: not to think about independent draws -- think about overall statement
Q1.1.2 formulate as "hypergeometric function"?
(why it's called "hypergeometric"? -- geometric function is ...??

Q1.2 properties for this distribution?
Q1.2.1 summary stats?
mean, quantiles
Q1.2.2 accumulative prob distribution?
Q1.2.3 other specific relations?
symmetry of the distribution on variable r;
symmetry between parameters: M and n!

Q1.3 other questions under "no replacement" setting -- red ball at nth draw?
general expression & intuition?
Q1.4 all the other variations?
