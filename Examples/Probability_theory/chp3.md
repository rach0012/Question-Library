# Q1 Probability distribution of drawing n red balls in a bicolor urn, with no replacement?
## Q1.1 General expression of the prob distribution: h(r|N,M,n)?
Derivation is easy.

### Q1.1.1 intuitive interpretation for this result?
to simplify: not to think about independent draws, but think about overall statement.

### Q1.1.2 formulate this distribution as a special function?
"hypergeometric function"
> why it's called "hypergeometric"? 

-- geometric distribution is Bernoulli with replacement, and asks about the number X of Bernoulli trials needed to get one success

## Q1.2 properties for this distribution?
### Q1.2.1 summary stats: mean, quantiles of h?
### Q1.2.2 accumulative prob distribution?
### Q1.2.3 other interesting properties -- symmetry in what aspects?
symmetry of the distribution on variable r;
symmetry between parameters: M and n!

## Q1.3 other questions under "no replacement" setting 
### Q1.3.1 red ball at nth draw?
doesn't matter the exact n / "temporal order"! 
general expression & intuition?
