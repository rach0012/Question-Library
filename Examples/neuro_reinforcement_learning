Q: computational problem? 
A: calculate value of your current state/a given stimuli/a given action

Q: how's Rescorla-Wagner model different from TD(temporal difference) model?
Q1: conceptually, how are they different?
--RW doesn't consider the future state value but TD incorporates that with current reward
Q2: how do they give different prediction?
--TD predicts "back-up" pheonomenon: that value change would propagate to other time steps(states). 
---yes, this has been seen in dopamine neuron!

Q: Is TD a good model?
Q1: what kinds of data can it fit?
behavioural or neural?
Q2: what can this model predict and has been tested? 
one strong assumption: since the "state" is expected value at each time step---if mess up the cue-onset time!
