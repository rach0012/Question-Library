1-what is decision-making?

1.1-conceptually?

1.1.1-parallel concept? [paraconcept]]

ans: everything - perception - motion = decision-making
perception = info input(through sensory info)
motion = decision output(through movement: pointing/speaking)

1.1.2-[subconcepts]

evidence -> decision variable -> termination rule (sequential analysis framework?)

1.1.3-affected by? [factors]
1.1.3.1-[internal factors]
attention, risk preference, knowledge
1.1.3.2-[external factors]
reward, difficulty, urgency(time constraint), etc.

1.1.4-operational def criterion? [def criterion]

won’t be confounded with sensory/motor process.

1.1.5-what are the functions that such a neuron should have (criteria)?[def criterion]

=> activity: stimulus/motion invariance, only related with decision(from 1.1.1); modulated by reward, difficulty, urgency, etc.(from 1.1.3);


1.2-empirical paradigm?

=> random dot task

1.2.1-is this paradigm good?

-limitation: can’t directly approach other decision related quantities, say, certainty=>sure-target task


2-how to find the neurons that are responsible for decision-making(of certain paradigm)?

2.1.1 what scale?

level: single neuron in one area; 

2.1.2-unit VS connection? 

single neuron activity

2.1.3-What feature of activity?

firing rate—but more specific: time course of each trial!

2.2 What methodology do you use to measure that?

electrophysiology.

(big caveat: cannot measure human directly….)


3-description

receptive field: should be insensitive to stimulus

temporal activity: ramping; in line with with exp process

=>LIP neurons, well serve as decision-making neural substrate


3.1.1 qualitative relation -> quantitative?

use model to relate activity with choice and reaction time?

DDM + boundary model!

# check the model

3.3.1check with data

3.3.1.2 make prediction? 

yes! fit & predict behavioral data [make prediction]

3.3.1.3 incorporate different aspects of data? 

yes!-accomodate different experimental conditons(eg: evidence strength, 

3.3.3 check with other levels of knowledge

3.3.3.1 conceptually, why is this a wanted model?[on the computational level]

arguement: in line with log likelihood ratio.



4-is that all about decision-making? what about other aspects of decision-making? // the following, a new question, can be organized with Q1-3 structure again!

other aspects include: how confident/certain about the decision;

4.1 Do monkeys know and use their decision uncertainty?

4.1.1 Behavioral paradigm to test that?

add a "sure target" (Kiani & Shadlen 2009)

4.1.2 Neural implementation?

4.1.2.1 Conceptually, what neurons should you look into?

-LIP neurons with response field of left/right decision --as in previous simple task.

-LIP neurons with response field of the new sure target

4.1.2.2 What would you expect to see in experiment, that implements the certainty calculation & decision?

calculation: LIP neurons with response field of left/right decision

decision of whether sure target is selected

4.1.3 Mathematical model for sure-target decision?



5-Is it possible to manipulate decision making? 

yes!

Electrical mu stimulation on left/right response field=>decision manipulated

5.1 limitation: how to interpret this behavioural change?

Are they feeling sth weird, or they really feel/"perceive" stronger motion direction?

5.1.1 how to test that(since you can't ask monkeys)?

--check the certainty change
