# How does children adapt their active learning strategy according to environment? ("i.e. Ecological learning")
*my takehome*: 1 good conceptual dichotomy of questioning: hypothesis scanning and constraint seeking. 2 motivation for learning stragety: environment probability distribution(rational); 3 constraint for learning strategy: cognitive resource/effort; abstraction level; confidence in prior knowledge (do they belief in the manipulation); 
*yet, what's the real question here?*
(1) think of real world task: constraint seeking question is really hard and rarely asked. **When will this dichotomy really matters?** eg: when is there uniform hypothesis space at all? what are other important factors prompt people to ask constraint-seeking qs?
--my guess: 1/ when you have no clue, yet need to really figure out the answer (like a detective)...may be parallel to the "uniform distribution" scenario. 2/ most likely 
(2) what is actually 

## to constrain the question: what is "active learning"? what are possible strategies? how does the environment change?
* asking question; or question selection as a subprocess
* possible strategies: hypothesis scanning (one-by-one); constraint seeking (half-rule-out) -- quantitatively distinguish? EIG. constraint seeking is usually higher EIG, more optimal
* environmental change: (exp1,3,4) probability distribution of answer(hypothesis) space; (exp2) the actual answer is low / high probability event

## exp1, hypotheses given, different distribution
### optimal way to adapt?
skewed distribution => do hypothesis scanning; uniform => constraint seeling; 
even hypothesis scanning is not highest EIG, it's optimal bc it's easy to come up with.

### how to characterize the level of adaptation?
* how much more constraint-seeking in uniform compare to skewed distribution?
* overall how many constraint seeking questions?
> adults give overall more cs qs but both have similar difference in uniform or skewed
### alternative interpretation: besides EIG, constraint seeking Qs are also more complex?
Eg: cs ques may contain more than 1 concepts, which are complicated and hard for kids to grasp.

## exp2, no hypothesis given, only replying YES or NO
imagine: if it's a low probability answer, should ask CS qs.
> more CS qs after "no" feedback(failed guess) cpred to "yes"

## exp3, same as 1, with question already generated, children only need to select
this is for younger (5 yrs old) subjects.
imagine: 1) younger guys less capable of choose correct question; 
> 4 yrs old are less capable to select the first best question; yet for those 4th years old are able to ask, 

## exp4, nonverbal as 1
