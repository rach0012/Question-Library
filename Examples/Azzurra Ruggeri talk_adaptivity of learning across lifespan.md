# How does children adapt their active learning strategy according to environment? ("i.e. Ecological learning")
## to constrain the question: what is "active learning"? what are possible strategies? how does the environment change?
* asking question
* possible strategies: hypothesis scanning (one-by-one); constraint seeking (half-rule-out) -- quantitatively distinguish? EIG. constraint seeking is usually higher EIG, more optimal
* environmental change: (exp1) probability distribution of answer(hypothesis) space; (exp2) the actual answer is low / high probability event

## exp1, hypotheses given
### optimal way to adapt?
hypothesis: skewed distribution => do hypothesis scanning; uniform => constraint seeing; 
even hypothesis scanning is not highest EIG, it's optimal bc it's easy to come up with.

### how to characterize the level of adaptation?
-- how much more constraint-seeking in uniform compare to skewed distribution?
-- overall how many constraint seeking questions?

## exp2,
