"brain is not neccessary if you can't move" -- the animal eats its own primitive brian when it stops to be able to move.

1-process flow of movement
muscle <--motoneuron(Spinal cord) <-- motor programs(modules of motor sequences?) <--cortex(vague "intention" initiates motor programs)

*types of muscles*
-Type I: slow, oxidative metabolism, long-lasting(little waste)
-Type II: fast, aerobic & anaerobic metabolism

*connection btw motoneuron ~ muscle*
basic figures: one motoneuron, one type of muscle(but maybe multiple fibers); 
activity: 
1)one spike, one contraction
2)one movement, multiple muscles! contraction && extension. Golgi tendon also involved in prohibiting extension reflex, so enables coordination.

*motor programs*
1) examples?
lower spinal cord: protective reflexes & locomotion generator
midbrain: breathing, chewing, eyemovements
hypothalamus: eating&seeking for food
cortex: facial expression, speech, etc

HTK? [decerebrate model] cut the connection btw pon&midbrain, see what functions can preserve? walking, chewing, etc, meaning these programs don't really need cortex.
[decortication model] cur connection btw diencephalon-telencephalon => complex movements okay, but not fine movements(Say, finger grasping)

*connection btw cortex ~ spinal cord*
Motor cortex(Betz Cells)->tracts(internal capsule)->Lateral Cortico-Spinal Tract
if LCST damaged=>top motorneuron damage. Then other more primitive xx-spino tracts become dominant! (Eg: vestibulo-spino tract, importantly keeps head position&many other position=> less wabbling)
--also worth noticing: pyramidal tract(=LCST?) receives input not only from motor cortex but also some from somaticsensory cortex!

*motor cortex*
1) subregions?(subconponent)
besides M1(primary motor cortex), many others
2) the overall picture:
motor cortex ~ basil ganglia; 
3) micro description: cytostructure
very little granular cells, as oppposed to prefrontal which has large layer IV(granular layer)
4) functional description: somatotopic map
5) functional description: different level of neural substances
5.1) signle neuron activation
-what's the behavioural paradigm? instruction->move wraist(->given loads/pertubation)
-what do we propose neurons can be encoding?
movement direction/velocity(kinetics); force in movement(dynamics)

>>biggest problem: what dimension of all possible representation are you in?

5.2) functional descripiton: look into multiple neuron state space
eg: movement direction & speed, different instructions result in different subspace(i.e. just firing differently for different movements...)
Hard to predict subspace for new movement??

But other predictions: state space VS movement output
-closer to the alternative subspace, movement also more similar to the alternative instruction
-closer to "optimal subspace", faster RT & lower fano factor(less noise)
-can develop decoder and use that for BMI!! monkey controls artifitial arms!

question:
-how's the optimal subspace developed during the learning? 
>>importantly, we haven't talked about learning at all!

6) functional description: different level of function
besides kinetics / dynamics...
-output is planning(~more related with cue) or actual movement(cue-irrelavant)?
-the sequence is mostly externally-directed(by visual cues, for eg) or internally-directed(by memory, for eg). There seems to be contrast between premotor cortex(cares only about external cue) VS supplimentary motor area(cares only abt internal cue) 



**how can these description be generalized to more different tasks?
**can you connect this with motor programs?
