Q1 neural circuits we are looking at?
A olfactory receptors -> mushroom bodies -> Antennal lobes
myQ: sounds like fruit fly! what’s different?

Q1.1 more quantitative description of structure? 
N kenyon cell ~ 4k; N projection neuron ~ 100=> divergence
then convergence to…?? 

Q1.2 functional mapping of connection?
Yes, convergence of same kinda input.

Q2 how do we model this circuit?
Q2.1 model goal of circuit function? [set-goal]
given odor, how positive or negative the output layer feels? 
Especially, work on the phenomena of “preference peak shift” after exposure to negative stimuli.
#but, how can stimuli be represented in a continuous dimension?

Q2.2 how to achieve that goal? [solution]
Q2.2.1 circuit structure?
3 layers of neurons with different numbers and activity patterns
between them: plastic synapses
Q2.2.2 circuit dynamics?
look at two parts of plasticity

Q2.3 how well this model is doing? [evaluation]
Q2.3.1 can it reproduce the computational function?
Q2.3.2 does it provide additional understanding of the other function/ more detailed mechanism?
Q2.3.3 does it provide novel prediction can be tested?
Q2.3.4 does it contradict with other phenomenon?

#how’s that decision represented in neuron model?
(in fact, just ratio of neurons activated in two parts of output layers?? what does “patterning” mean?)
(is that a distinct circuit from odor distinction?(it’s just valence judgment here)
