Q: Can animals generalize what they learn?
Q1: Behavioural paradigm?
--1) see generalization curve of cue property(say, conditioned stimulus be a tone of 80Hz, then test reaction to 50~130Hz tones) 2) combine two cues
Q2: Computational model?
--1) an intermediate layer of stimulus representation => single training stimuli will activate several nodes in the intermediate layer thus generalization occurs[everything ensured by this nodes connection]

Q: How do you decide what to generalization(what are "similar stimulus", psychologically?)
Q1: How do you establish the computational algorithm?
--Given pairwise similarity, how do you place each item into a space that you can define their "psychological distance"?
(Roger Shepard 1987)
--A1: multi-dimensional scaling 
Q1.1: Clarification: What are input and output of the algorithm?
--input: May use pure "similarity response" or more complicated probes like conditioning reponse
--output: multi-dimensional space of stimuli
Q1.2: What can we learn from fitted parameters?
--dimensionality of psychological space. Say, tones are best represented by a 3D spiral, whereas color is a 2D ring.
--metrics of stimulus: L(1) norm ("city-block metrics") is better fitted than Eucledian distanc
