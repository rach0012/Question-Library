central Q: how do language related studies show that "the resources needed to express all concepts humans can represent are available throughout development, even at the beginning"?
//what's the "core cognition" revealed in language studies?

# Q: how does the acquisition of language interacts with the way people learn concepts? 

I would think it as: 
1) before language is acquired, concepts are fuzzy and not distinctive from each other 
2) after having language we first study the name of a new concept. and we have an expectation that new concept should have a name (eg: naming some fuzzy behavior as "imposter syndrome" makes us feel good -- feels like it's more than bc concept provides some explanation)

Quine's doctrine of strong linguistic determinism: only after learning language. then adults have radically different representaitons.
Compared to my 1), "language determinism" is much stronger about how stupid infants are. Eg, they may argue children don't recognize "is" (~"same"). Is that true?

> general research strategy: 
* find a "fundamental concept" (explicitly expressed in language grammars, for the scope of this chapter), such as singular(=1) VS mass (>1), which is not acquired at first (not a *core concept).
* test at what age can children grasp these concepts by nonlinguistic tasks
* test at what age can children learn the corresponding linguistic regularities.
* check the relation between concept and language learning. By: 1) test neccessity of language: check alternative languages without such linguistic distinction; or check animals 2) test other factors that affect the grasp of concept (Eg, visual cues)


# topic 1: singular/plural distinction
major paradigm: ["lack of plural concept": cracker choice / box-search tasks]
infants succeeds at identifying "3 items" as "more than 1", but fails at 4 items, meaning they still don't have the concept that "all plurals are bigger than 1" (Feigenson & Carey, 2005).
--author says, "plural" is not included in "core cognition" system.
Then, does language acquisition makes them smarter? (i.e. is it sufficient/neccessary that those who can understand single-plural distinction will successfully perform this task?)

## Q1 how to test if a child has learnt the single-plural distinction? 
[searching time in box after diff instructions] (Wood, Kouider, & Carey) 
-- when given different intro description of the content in the box. Test if plural description results in longer search time in the box with only 1 item.
## Q2 at what age will children be able to distinguish plural-single? //I've always dubious about these "age-oriented" questions: aren't there a lot of group difference?
"We can be confident that English-learning children begin to appreciate the force of the contrast between “is a noun-Ø” versus “are some noun-s” between the ages of 20 and 24 months."
## Q3 is this same time that children start to success in "4-1" contrast task?
almost -- "nonlinguistic box-search task...at 22 months of age, but not at 20 months"
## Q4 causality between linguistic and nonlinguistic distinction between single & plural? 

[non-plural language speaking children learns nonlinguistic distinction later?] (Barner, Ogura, Yange & Carey, 2008; Li,Yang, Barner,& Carey, 2008)
--chinese / japanese kids learn that concept at similar time as English speakers!
[nonlinguistic animals also learn the single-plural difference?] (Barner, Wood, Houser, & Carey, in press; Barner, Thalwitz, Wood, & Carey, 2008)
yes! Rhesus macaques are great!
"Using two different methods (the food-choice task, and simple habituation), these authors have found success at discriminating 1 from other set sizes (1 vs. 2, 1 vs. 3, 1 vs. 4, and 1 vs. 5) in the face of failure at 2 versus 3, 2 versus 4, and 2 versus 5."
the key seems to be let "the sets of multiple objects move as a rigid whole".

okay, " acquiring the singular/plural distinction does not require Quinian bootstrapping". 
### Q5 What is needed for the development of "concept of plural", if it's not language?
(we've only denied a possibility
my guess: enough perceptual evidence & the need to distinguish "one" v.s. "some". so...what aspect of their life has been changed??
Carey's speculation: this distinction helps to distinguish "kind" and "instance" -- a kind includes multiple instances. 


“Quinian linguistic determinism may characterize the ontogenetic origin of some concepts” -- chp 8-11!


# topic 2: kind sortals
central Q: are infants able to distinguish things from 2 kinds as 2 things?
paradigms [habituation on a hand lifting 2 items/only one]Xu, Carey, & Welch, 1999.)
--well, but if the hands lifts 2 ducks? should you be astonished? (same kinds, but still shouldn't be viewed as a whole and lifted together)
it more seems to me the younger guys are not familiar with the concept of duck/car. Or, they are actually learning that there's a new kind as "duckcar"!

How is it that language comes to be integrated with nonlinguistic representations? (viewing language as an additional component for the preexisting concepts...eg, imprinted concept of "Caretaker")

# other language related "fundamental concepts"?
eg: "is".  children "do have the expressive power to represent the is or same of numerical identity (they distinguish numerically distinct individual objects from each other)"

# during language learning, what are some fundamental structures?
[phenomenon: generalization of concept during (syntactic bootstrapping)]
(Gleitman and her colleagues 2005) having learnt how vt and vi are used differently, will be able a new verb to be vt by identifying there's an noun followed by this verb. i.e. able to constraint the meaning of this concept by the syntactic constraint.
?? what is semantic bootstrapping? can't understand. 
=> dispute: is this an innate ability or something learnt after learning language? 
--to my understanding, equivalent to ask: that prelinguistic children don't have the concept of vi/vt, countable/proper nouns? 


-----
my randoms Q along reading:
-what are the "2 core concept systems"? (the first explicit lexical contrasts with quantificational force that children learn in English are singular/plural markers, such as the contrast between “is a X” and “are some Xs.” Even the singular/plural distinction is not naturally expressed in terms of the two core systems discussed in chapter 4.)
-what are the salient examples supporting that human are "language acquisition device (LAD)", or we are born prepared for language acquisition?
(broca area? how does it work during development -- or why it's not a consequence of language acquisition?)
----
other Qs not touched in this chapter but are relevant:
Q:  Will language learning leads speakers of different languages to think differently about the world?
Q: can those "prelinguistic concepts" be applied to animals? -- yes, singular for monkeys.
