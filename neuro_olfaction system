main arguments:
-pathway of olfaction
-quantifying the complexity of system(# of oders, receptors, receptor genes, intermediate neurons, projections...)

question left(that I'm interested in):
1-why not constructing order space by objective oder feature?
--because in the end, "oder receptors" are just chemical reactions. Can't we characterize order by its chemical properties??
2-genetic categorization of receptors
2.1 mechanistically: how is genetical categorization of receptors functionally meaningful?
eg: gene<->chemical reaction sites?
2.2 why are these genes chosen? why this number of genes?
hypo1: making sure "important oders" can be distinguished? [what are *important* oders?] optimal info encoding(best precision, least redundance)?
hypo2: basic space then transform...
3-similarly, is there optimal encoding for the first several steps of transformation?
from more abstract level, how would you design a system for order encoding?
general encoding principles?
4-behaviourally, what is "recognize a smell"?
how would you able to distinguish there's "one smell" or mixture of smells?
is there "smell invariance"? (more about object recognition. seems like this is not a major problem for olfaction?)
are all smells connect with emotion? other non-neural response? can you characterize smells by their elicited response?

==="textbook" questions===
1-What is olfaction?
1.1-Conceptually, what is olfaction? [concept def]
1.1.1-What are the parallel concepts? Contradictory concepts? What is not olfaction? (same level) [paraconcept]
hyper concept: chemical sense.
other chemical senses: gustation, nociception
1.1.2-What constitutes olfaction? (lower level) [subconcepts]
sensory process: stimulus->receptors->neural networks(->behaviour)?
sensory computation: concentration sensing & discrimination; signal comparison(=>memory); adaptation(learning); 
1.1.2.1 How to characterize olfactory stimulus?
olfactory space: seems infinite dimension of space! no simple way to characterize smells.
=>from chemical features of molecules?(Keller et al. 2017, Science)
=>if can't characterize by physical/chemical features, go to neural straight


//1.1.3-What factors will influence xxx? [factors]
//1.1.4-(Based on above) What are the criterions of the operational definition of xxx? [def criterion]
1.1.5-(Based on above) What are the criterions of the neural substrate of xxx? [def criterion]
1.2-Empirically, what are the experimental paradigm to study olfaction?
1.2.1 what bio system shall we study? [model system]
start from bacteria; C-elegang &  fly also works
1.2.1.1 Why bacteria?can you define olfaction in bacteria at all? [def criterion]
--yes, chemotaxis. it includes: (chemical) concentration sensing & discrimination; signal comparison(=>memory); adaptation(learning); (ref to 1.1.2)
1.2.1.2 why fly?
big advantage over mouse: receptors are exposed and easy to patch

1.3-What are noticeable (behavioral) phenomenons about olfaction?[behav signature]
-for human: related with major depression; family relation; mating.

//below we actually talk about 2&3 together. yet since it's lecture, no testing of relatiosni are emphasized. most are just conclusions ("should be believed as true")
2-What neural substrates are we looking at? (What level are we studying?)
olfaction is a huge system so we talk about all levels.
2.1 start coarse: what's the pathway? What are key processes?
receptors in olfactory epithelium-> [glomeruli->mitral cells] olfactory bulbs->cortex
Then we look into each process(& connection)
2.2 receptors
2.2.1 basic numbers & categorization?
--where are they?
--in human: 350 gens, 5-10k glomeruli; mouse, 1e3 genes, 1e6 receptor cells, 2~3e3 glomeruli.
--how to categorize? by genetics! 350 genes ~ 350 receptors
2.2.2 activity: what does olfactory receptors respond to?
qualitative: different oders, different responses. however, it's not 1 to 1 mapping!
quantitatively, how oder concentration change affects activity?( "like, tuning curve")
populational tuning curve on oder concentration


2.3 glomerulus
synaptic area of between olf nerves terminal & dentrites of mitral (&periglomerular and tufted cells)
2.3.1 basic number
many(?) receptors of same gene -> 1 glomerulus -> 20-40 mitral cells(with diff tuning!)
2.3.2 activity
2.3.2.1 populational organization?
space distribution of glomeruli: conserved between individuals & kinda between rat&mice. (Soucy et al. 2009)
2.3.2.2 computationally, signal transformation?
a-convergence of receptors to glomerulus, then mitral cells -=> amplification gain about 250x!
(HTK: by measuring temporal course of spikes, PN turns out fire ealier than OSN--than measured OSN. )
??OSN, PN = ?
b-from glomerulus to mitral: synapse with both excitatory & inhibitory receptor
the overall analogy between primary visual & olfactory processing


2.4 mitral cell
2.3.1 basic number?
1 glomerulus -> 20-40 mitral cells
2.3.2 projection: to where? cortex!
--where in cortex? everywhere! 
--Is it same for all glomerulus? yes! almost random connection.
2.3.3 computationally, if it's trully random connection, how to compute useful info?
2.3.3.1 why might this random connection be good?
- assumption: better discrimination. (put shirts close to CD so that large and small shirts won't be confounded with each other)
-yet how to generalize the representation? When you smell sth new, how do you say it's "similiar to smell A more than B?"
