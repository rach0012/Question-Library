what is touch?
1.1 conceptual def
â€¦
1.2 operational def
1.2.1 animal system
mouse usually(only mammals help??)


2-neural substrate?
2.1 coarse pathway: 
terminal receptors -> dorsal root ganglion -> spinal cord
differentiated by hairy / glabrous(non-hairy) skin!

# A: globrous skin
2.2 receptors
2.2.1 basic stats? where are they?
(Basic stats missed)
on skin! (even around the hair,  still in skin levels)
2.2.2 categorization/profile? -- by shape of receptos => functions
- by how deep the receptors are
# shallow surface
[Meissner's corpules] mainly located in glabrous skins; rapidly adpating, aka response to "ON" and a bit "OFF" touch, or change of touch; (yes, correspond to my experience! Sometimes I don't ) => sensitive to surface texture when you move on it.
[Merkel cells] also in hairy cells, derma-epiderma junction. slowly adaptive, fire during whole process of touch
# deep in skin
[Pacinian corpuscle] response to change of speed of touching--again, ~ ON and OFF response. But much higher frequency than Meissner's! (why need that? because touching is giving feedback to motion! e.g. controling a pencil to write)

#interesting concept: perception VS touch
either "press" or "tap" is an interpretation!

2.2.3 quantitative characterization of functions
2.2.3.1 how large the receptive field is?
around palm, much larger(thus much coarser); finger tips smaller
2.2.4 mechanism: why do they have different adaptation frequency?
different channel activation/inactivation properties

2.3.DRGs: cell property & function
2.3.1 basic figures? categorization?
figures? not known
2.3.2 genetics profile
differen in size, gene expression(~different somatisensory receptors) and skin innervation
2.3.3 connection
2.3.3.1 anatomy of single nerves & conductance
3 groups of cutaneous nerve;
bigger axons ~ more myelin ~ bigger conduction velocity
2.3.3.2 development of connection
needs neurotrophins expressed by skin/muscle to help DRGs find correct terminal points
2.3.4 functional activity(how's sensory transduction happen?)
general process: (mechanical receptor) force->mechanical tranducer->action potential
step1, sense the force
a-what's the response? AP or EPSP/IPSP?
epsp on nerves
but also firing rate corresponds to stimulus intensity
b-what affects the response?
stronger the bigger, of course
b.1-further differentiating possible forms of "touches"
press, brush, or freeze(not touch the skin, just the hairs)
b.2-further differentiating possible receptors: different receptors on different skin regions(2.2.2)
c-what's the mechanism transforming force to channel openning?
piezo channels.
Yet what about different receptors? Is it different piezos or different network connectivity/amplification/etc?

step 2 use the sense:  to perceive objects held in the hand!
Eg stim 1: Braille letters

--
B: hairy skin
2.2 receptor: different types
around the hair / blabla 
2.3 fibers: 3 type again.
single fiber has divergent receptor connections
2.4 Dorsal R Ganglion
2.5 spinal cord
several ascending pathways
2.6 cortex
2.6.1 anatomy?
2.6.1.1 subregions and their connection 
--as expected, there's hierachical connections, as in visual system
2.6.1.2 subregions comparison
size comparison: 
topological mapping
2.6.1.3 layers of cortex
there's vertical columns

2.6.2 function?
2.6.2.1 receptive field
different areas have different sizes of RF
2.6.2.2 emergence of such RF?
combination of excitatory & inhibitory RF
2.6.2.3 functional selectivity?
direction selectivity in area 2
2.6.2.4 learning & plasticity?
2.6.2.4.1 operational maniplation?
-leision the nerve=>depriving sensory input
-training of one hand but not the other
-amputees with "phantom hand" illusion
2.6.2.4.2 neural change
-remapping of RF
-intensity of activity
2.6.2.5 other higher-level factors that affects neural processing?
factors: attention(gain); learning/adaptation; goal of task
