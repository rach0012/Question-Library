1 what is consciousness?
1.1 conceptually, what is consciousness?
1.1.1 intuitively, do we agree that sth is conscious / sth is more conscious than others?
do we see computers as conscious?
are human always conscious?
is conscious a binary or graded concept?
do we use “conscious” to describe an organism(“entity”), or 
1.1.2 parallel concepts?
1.1.3 subconcepts?
1.1.4 consequence of consciousness: how does the level of consciousness affect other processes? 
(1) conscious perception
eg: gives prediction and bias the active sampling of sensory input
(2) what else? besides perception, can you define other conscious process?

1.2 behaviorally, how to define that?
whether you can report the stimuli presented: by adjusting intensity of signal, or by showing ambiguous stimuli(eg mooney image)

2 what might be neural mechanism?
2.1 what neural object to see?
-localized activation: correlation of area activation of different stimulus(if perceived, brain response differently to different stimulus)
-more globalized signal:
*gamma band oscillation*
*slow cortical potential* — Biyu’s idea for possible neural correlates of consciousness.
