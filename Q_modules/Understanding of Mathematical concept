1. Why do we come up with this concept? 
1.1 To abstract common features of a kind of things that is accord with intuition? (e.g. numbers, area a segment, set, limit, Lebesgue 
measure, Probablity measure, integrity)
1.2 To abstract common features of a kind of things just for some kind of beauty? (e.g. group...)
2. Why do we define a concept in such a way?
2.1 Accord with intuition. (e.g. area of a segment, number, set, Lebesgue measure)
2.2 This kind of common features can get some other common features we want.
