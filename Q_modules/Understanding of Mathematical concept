1. Why do we come up with this concept?
1.1 Do you have enough examples of this concept?
1.2 Can you find some common features of these examples?
(To abstract common features of a kind of things that you can find many examples? (e.g. numbers, area a segment, set, limit, Lebesgue 
measure, Probablity measure, integrity)
To abstract common features of a kind of things that you do not familiar with? (e.g. group...))
2. Why do we define a concept in such a way?
2.1 Accord with your intuition in life? (e.g. area of a segment, number, set)
2.2 Or, this kind of common features are accord with you intuition in life and can get some other common features we want, also, 
they do not contradicts each other? (e.g. Lebesgue outer measure, probablity measure)
