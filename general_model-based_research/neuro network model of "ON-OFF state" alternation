1-phenomenon to be modeled?
When animal is not performing task(Eg, sleep, anesthetized), in mPFC, LFP may have occassional burst which correspond to silence of firing in excitatory and inhibitory pyramidal neurons in mPFC. Those firing are termed "OFF" states which transits in to "ON" states...
1.1-how to quantify the phenomenon?
Duration distribution of ON and OFF states
1.2-why wanna study this phenomenon?
