#from a seminar by Brent Doiron titled "The mechanics of cortical variability"

subject of study: single neuron spiking rates & std. e.g.: trial by trial variability.

1-phenomenon
1) bigger SE in higher level cortex
2) bigger var —bigger covariance(not smaller mean) when higher attention level
=>study how attention affects variability

2-how is the variability implemented?
2.1-define variation
correlation between 2 neurons -- which 2 neurons? 
(1) can do dimension reduction
=>1st eigenvector of covar mat 
(2) neurons in same region VS between regions?
these two are opposite! between-region correlation actually increase with attention, while in-region correlation decrease(=more variability)
(3) temporal window for correlation?
first 200ms.

2.2-how to conceptualize this attention VS cortical variability relation?
attention ~->Hidden variable(“brain state") ~-> neural response R

theoretical model: [E/I network] model
(sub q net: how to work on [E/I network] model? (1) what are essential model parameters (2) what are necessary properties of good network model?(sanity check) (3) specific propertes on topic)
2.2.1 network setting
2.2.1.1 how many networks; local / global network?
—between-region model? H->R should be independent in each level
2.2.1.2 E/I balance: total number; temporal dynamics(e.g. time constant); mean/variance?
2.2.2 network activity sanity checks
a-check how the system scales up of num of neurons affect mean & var 
b-check if the network balances
c-EI balance
2.2.3 topic specific settings & activity
settings: a hidden variable for each local network—an internally generated variability
activity output: increased covariance between regions & decreased within region when attention increases.


(3-Why’s variability? Functional advantage of that? — how’s 2 related to 3?)
